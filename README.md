# Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival
This is the 3rd project in the openclassrooms Front end developer bachelor diploma. The project brief is as follows:

### Website prototype
You'll need to make a first version of the site that meets all the requirements Jennifer explained above. The website prototype should be in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. You don't actually need to buy the .com or the .org though; you can simply propose it in your project brief.

The pre-registration page doesn't need to be functional. It should be a simple page with a form that doesn't actually submit data to a real codebase.

The webpage you build can be a local set of HTML and CSS files on your computer. There's no need to host or deploy the site.

### Project brief
Make your communication with the client easier by writing a document that puts you both on the same page! In it, you'll cover logistical details about the overall project as well as technical details about the website you create.

Create a project brief from the description above and the clientâ€™s requests. It must have the following elements:

* Summary
* Stakeholders
* Goals
* Budget
* Timeline
* Technical specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic)

## UX
Bootstrap 4 was used to achieve a mobile friendly design. I used a common layout in order to keep the site navigation familiar and easy to understand - implementing a collapsable navigation menu at the top of the site. I made a few small alterations to the default bootstrap styles in order to give the site a unique look.

## Testing


## Deployment
THe site has been deployed to github pages and can be view here:[Brooklyn Film Festival](https://the-masta-blasta.github.io/outdoor_film_festival/)

You can also experience the website on your local network by cloning the repo or downloading it from github. Once downloaded, you should open terminal (mac / linux) or the command line (windows). cd into the project directory and run a simple server. You can use the following command if you have python3 installed: python3 -m http.server

## Difficulties
When using Bootstrap, I have up until this project used Bootstrap 3. I used this project as an opportunity to update my Bootstrap knowledge and start using Bootstrap 4. There have been quite a few changes made to Bootstrap, so initially I had a few problems using old class names, but as far as difficulties go this was minor, and was a good learning experience.

## Further enhancements
While this particular project was simply a prototype, it would be nice to see it connected to a backend database (for storing user details) and a Movie API that the site could draw its movie information from.
